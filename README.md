## Materials We Provide
<!--- This section is a table of contents for the lesson. The table structure breaks down typical lesson resources into types, distinguishing between lesson notebooks and other supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development Environment | A quick check to ensure that git and Anaconda are working | [install_check.md](./install_check.md) |
| Course Info and Definitions | Jupyter notebook to define common terms for the course and machine learning | [course_info_documentation.ipynb](./course_info_definitions.ipynb) |
| Intro to Python Fundamentals | Jupyter notebook for the first dive into Python | [intro_to_python_fundamentals.ipynb](./intro_to_python_fundamentals.ipynb) |
