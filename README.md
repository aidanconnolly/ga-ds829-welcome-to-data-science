## Materials We Provide
<!--- This section is a table of contents for the lesson. The table structure breaks down typical lesson resources into types, distinguishing between lesson notebooks and other supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lesson | Interactive jupyter notebook with structured lesson content | [Link](./xyz)|
| Data | Local copy of any dataset used | [Link](./xyz)|
|      | Additional datasets listed | [Link](./xyz)|
| Practice | Student activities | [Link](./xyz)|
| Solutions | Sample solutions to lesson and practice files | [Link](./xyz)|
| Slides | Slide decks & PDFs, where applicable | [Link](./xyz)|
| Extra Resources | Other files, if applicable | [Link](./xyz) |

## Learning Objectives
<!--- This section lists the learning objectives of the lesson. For information on how to write clear learning objectives, see: http://ii.library.jhu.edu/2016/07/20/writing-effective-learning-objectives/ --->

- **Define** learning objectives with a bolded action verb and descriptive, measurable statement
- **Explain** the difference between causation and correlation
- **Determine** causality and sampling bias using Directed Acyclic Graphs
- **Identify** what missing data is and how to handle it
- **Test** a hypothesis using a sample case study

## Student Requirements
<!--- This section explains the relevant prerequisites; in other words, what do students need to know to be able to benefit and perform the tasks required in this lesson? This includes lists of skills or prior learning objectives --->

**Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to**:
- Perform simple statistical analysis in Pandas
- Define a foundational understanding of bias, variance, and correlation
- Create box and line plot visualizations in Seaborn
- Discuss common considerations within experimental design

## Additional Resources
<!--- This section lists useful reference materials that can inform, extend, or deepen a student's understanding of the material. While this may seem like a "nice to have" feature, we normally see a range of advanced and remedial students in our classes. Curating these resources allows us to provide targeted materials and suggestions that instructors can use to support different student needs. --->
